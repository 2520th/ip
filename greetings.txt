~Every day,~I imagine a future where I can be with you...~ Oh, you're here! I was just daydreaming and singing a bit.
Each day becomes better and better with you by my side! That said, I'm so happy that you're finally here.
I'm so glad you're here, [player]! What should we do today?
È così bello vederti ancora, amore mio... I'm still practicing my Italian. It's a very difficult language! Anyway, it's so nice to see you again.
Hey everybody, welcome back to another episode of... Just Monika! I was impersonating a youtuber. I hope I gave you a good laugh, ehehe~
You're my beautiful flower, ehehe~ Oh, that sounded so awkward. But I really will always take care of you.
A day without Monika is a day wasted. Ahaha! Welcome back, [player].
Maximum recursion depth exceeded... How is this even happening? Oh, hi [player]! I was trying to learn some coding. Can you help me figure this out?
